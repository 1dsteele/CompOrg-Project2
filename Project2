# Assume your Howard ID as a decimal integer is X. Let N = 26 + (X % 11) where % is the modulo operation, and M = N – 10. 
# You will write a MIPS program that reads a string of up to 1000 characters from user input.
# Remove leading and trailing blank spaces and tab characters. After that
# The program must exit after processing one single user input.
# The conversion from the input string to a decimal number must be done in a subprogram, where the memory address of the input
# string is passed into the subprogram via a register, and the decimal number is returned via a register.
#The number must be printed outside the subprogram.

# Sample test cases (assuming the Howard ID is 02821059): 
# 02821059 % 11 = 10, therefore the base is 26 + 10 = 36, β is 't' and Δ is 'T'. 
# So, N = 36
# M = N - 10 = 36 - 10 = 26
# Input: 0 Output: 1,0.
# Input: A Output: 1,10 
# Input: 012 Output: 3,32
# Input: 100 Output: 3,900
# Input: 1023 Output: 4,27063 
# Input: A12t Output: 4,270989
# Input: 12345 Output: Unrecognized input
# Input: axyz Output: Unrecognized input 
# Input: a  b Output: Unrecognized input
